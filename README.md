# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  
  Interpreting user needs can be tricky, especially when the user does not know exactly how to explain what it is that they want in a program. Communication with the user and describing what you "can" do is a good way to start. User stories help with interpreting user needs by allowing the developer to understand the acceptable criteria for the user. The simple temple of "As a (role), I want (to be able to do something), so that (benefit).

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

As of right now, the only programs I have developed are for school. With that being said my approach for developing them is to just find a way to make them function cleanly since most of the time I will be working with new concepts while developing. In the future I would like to see myself implement some sort of user story and tester spreadsheet for the programs I develop. I believe it will help me center my thoughts as well as provide me with a reference to look back on when developing other programs in the future.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  You must have many traits to become a good team member in any team. However for software development, I believe a good team member will not only be knowledgable in software development, but also be knowledgable in gaining more knowledge. Tech is always evolving and keeping up with what is new and what works best is an incredibly important trait to have.
